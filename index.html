        <p class="parent-text">This project is dedicated to my mother, Mrs Gbemisola Ganiat Jide-Ajayi . My mother has been the cornerstone of my journey towards achieving my 
            dreams and goals. Her unwavering support and boundless encouragement have been my guiding light. From the 
            earliest days, she instilled in me the values of perseverance and resilience. Her belief in my abilities
            never wavered, even when I doubted myself. I am sure you must have heard of some mothers who inconvenience 
            themselves to ensure sure their children are comfortable... Trust me when i say my mother is one of those wonderful 
            people.She celebrated my successes and comforted me in my failures, 
            always reminding me that every setback was a stepping stone to greater things. Her nurturing spirit and 
            constant motivation have been instrumental in shaping the person I am today. I owe my strength and
             determination to her endless love and support.</p>

        <p class="parent-text">I also dedicate this project to my father, Mr Babajide Muhammed Ajayi. My father has been a pillar of wisdom and guidance throughout my
             life. His insightful advice and steadfast belief in my potential have been crucial in my journey towards my
              goals. He taught me the importance of hard work, integrity, and dedication. His own life, filled with 
              perseverance and achievements, has been a source of inspiration for me. He encouraged me to dream big and
              provided the practical support needed to turn those dreams into reality. His faith in my abilities gave 
              me the confidence to pursue my passions and overcome obstacles. I am deeply grateful for his unwavering 
              support and the invaluable lessons he has imparted to make me who i am and what i am able to achieve today.</p>
